# !! Work in Progress !!  
## Infomation
  
Open Drone Open-source Project  
LICENSE GNU GPLv3  
  
WEB http://opendrone.at/  
WIKI  https://github.com/OpenDroneAT/OpenDrone-FlightController/wiki#our-fly-opendrone-wiki

We here at OpenDrone love Open Source and Drones. So why not combine them?  
So this is an open source project for a self-flying and navigating drone.  
We also got an Open-source Frame Created with ❤️ by our 3D Printer  

Used technologies:  
* Android - Our App runs on Android  
* C++ - Our flight controller runs on C++  
* Raspberry Pi - The brain of the drone
